# Trip Planner App

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite web application for planning trips. Features:
- Input start/end locations, round-trip, trip type (road or flight)
- Date/time picker, passenger count, vehicle fuel-efficiency, budget, interests, dietary restrictions
- Map display with OpenStreetMap + Leaflet
- Service integrations for fuel cost, flight price, accommodations, events
- PDF export of itinerary

Please generate components under `src/components` and services under `src/services` following these requirements. Ensure the code is modular, typed, and includes placeholder stubs for API integration.
